Download the following files in this folder and make sure they (the downloaded files) are in the same directory:

- May_29_IEEE_Node_4_Feeder.glm
- converted0.csv

**DO NOT** use excel to open CSV files. It changes the timestamp column format. Open it with any other text editor. I recommend **NotePad++** or **sublime text**
